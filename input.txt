New Frontiers missions are mid-range missions intended to explore our solar system. They each have a budget that is capped at roughly one billion dollars. For comparison, the cost of the Curiosity Rover and the upcoming Mars 2020 rover each cost over two billion dollars. Previous New Frontiers missions have taken us out to Pluto (New Horizons), Jupiter (Juno), and one of them (OSIRIS-REx) is careening towards an asteroid. Now it's almost time to add another mission to the list. NASA asked for contenders that fit one of six themes, including returning a sample from either a comet or the Moon's south pole, probing Saturn, exploring Venus, rendezvousing with a Trojan Astroid, or heading out to the ocean worlds Titan and/or Enceladus.The mission to 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko is called the Comet Astrobiology Exploration Sample Return (CAESAR). It’s similar to the recently-launched OSIRIS-REx mission, which is venturing off to collect a sample from the Asteroid Bennu. CAESAR would pick up about 100 grams of material from the surface of the comet, and then send the samples speeding back to Earth for scientists to analyze.
The potential mission to Titan is called Dragonfly, and sounds incredibly cool. It acts like a rover, taking measurements along the ground, but would then also be able to fly to different spots on the moon’s surface, potentially flying hundreds of miles from its initial landing site in the course of a 2 year mission. For comparison, the Mars Rover Opportunity has traveled about 27 miles in 13
